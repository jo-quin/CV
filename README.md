I am a self-taught software developer who thinks technology and science can change the world in a positive way. 

Before joining Makers I thought of myself as a self-taught programmer than can develop code to solve peopleâ€™s problems. 
In Makers I learned to solve the same problems in a more efficient way, developing code that is tested, easy to change and easy to understand. While studying at Makers, I worked in many team projects where I learned a lot from my colleagues and realised how the final product is of higher quality when working with other great developers. 

Currently looking for my first tech job, a role where I can keep learning new and exciting ways to solve challenging problems.
