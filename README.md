A sentence about who and what you are:

Then a sentence about what you've achieved:
After learning all I could about programming and Python from any online course provider, blog or YouTube video I could find I can now write code to help other people and businesses.

And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment:
I am looking for a job where I can keep learning new and exciting ways to develop code that can change the world!
